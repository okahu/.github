## Welcome to Okahu's Github

### We're an AI startup for AI engineers

We build a AI Observability platform to helps AI engineers understand AI apps and infra to make them work better in production.

We're focused on making observability for AI workloads in production simple and effective so that everyone can benefit from reliable & cost-effective AI. 

### AI Observability as a Service

Observe your AI apps and cloud infra they run on to understand how to make them work better.  

- *Discover* components that build up your AI app and their dependencies to understand how your app works.
- *Observe* execution of your app & consumption of AI infra to understand what impacts operation of your app. 
- *Understand* the impact of the problem in a human language not logs and what to fix to resolve - the app code, the model or infra components.
- *Optimize* or resolve the issue automatically through policies on usage, resourcing and more.
